Welcome to moltemplate's documentation!
=======================================

Warning: This manual does not explain how build molecules that use all-atom force fields, or how to to run reactive (a.k.a. “active-matter”) simulations.

However numerous examples and README files are available to demonstrate
how to run these kinds of simulations. Downloading these examples is
highly recommended. (See section `2 <#sec:installation>`__.)
